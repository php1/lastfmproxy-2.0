Description: proxy server for the last.fm radio streams
 LastFMProxy allows you to use your regular old audio player 
 to listen to the last.fm streams. It does this by acting as 
 a player itself, connecting to the server on your behalf, 
 but instead of playing the stream, it simply relays it to 
 whichever other application connecting to it.
